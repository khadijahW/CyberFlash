# Frontend
- The frontend folder contains the files used to host the static website
- The api folder contains the dotnet API deployed to Azure functions
- The main.js file contains the visitor counter code

# Backend 
 - This is where the HTTP trigger function resides. When the functions is triggered it retrieves the CosmosDB item and adds 1 to it and returns this value to the GetResumeCounter
